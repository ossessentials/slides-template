   {Needed Tools}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item
      We need to use some tools before we learn about them!
      \item
      Otherwise it will be difficult to accomplish even simple
      tasks
      \item
      We will introduce some subjects briefly here, without
      much explanation. Topics to research!
   \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\cprotect\note{

   Trying to learn \textbf{axiomatically} (never doing any
   forward referencing, making sure everything mentioned
   has already been taught) is both boring and inefficient.

   All students have probably had significant previous
   experience either with other operating systems, or with
   \textbf{Linux} itself.

   Thus we are going to orient ourselves with the use of
   certain tools right away, so we can begin doing useful
   work from the start.  Later we will discuss each of
   these items in more detail.
